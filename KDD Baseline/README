1. feature Extraction
To run feature extraction, run:

python extract_features.py

if you want to specify a different path for audio files:

python extract_features.py -p path/to/main/audio/folder

if you want to specify a different path for metadata:

python extract_features.py -l path/to/metadata/file

Meanwhile, the audio duration check in the original kdd codes is by default disabled in this version.
If you want to enable it:

python extract_features.py -c True


2. Flac to wav
If you want to turn flac file to wav, run:

python flac_to_wav.py -p path/to/main/audio/folder

3. Test with model
The usage is simple, just run:

python model.py

Arguments you can use include:

--x_data_path or -x, where the data located, should be in npy format
--y_data_path or -y, where the label located, should be in npy format
--uid_path or -u, where the id located, should be in npy format
--train_set or -t, the path to the file that list all id for training
--val_set or -v, the path to the file that list all id for validation, not used for now
--model or -m, which model to use, currently there are svm(SVM), lr(Logistic Regression), rf(Random Forest), bt(Gradient Boosting Decision Trees)
--data_part or -d, which data part(s) are used in training, you can choose all, breath or cough.

The data_part-related functions are hard-coded and only for kdd. You would want to delete related codes in other applications.
